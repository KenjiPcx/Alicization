## Previous Progress: Drag Logic Refactoring

### Overview
Completed a major refactoring of the office objects drag and drop system by extracting repetitive database logic from individual components into a centralized `DraggableObjectWrapper`. This eliminated significant code duplication and simplified the architecture.

### Problem Solved
**Before**: Each object component (Plant, Couch, Bookshelf, Pantry, TeamCluster) contained identical database logic:
- State management for `officeObjectId`
- Database operations: `getOrCreateOfficeObject`, `updateOfficeObjectPosition`, `getOfficeObject`  
- Initialization effects to create/get office objects
- Drag end handlers to save positions
- Position management (using saved position if available)

This resulted in ~50 lines of repetitive code in each component.

### Solution Implemented
**Centralized Database Logic**: Moved all database operations into `DraggableObjectWrapper`:
- Added database-related props: `companyId`, `meshType`, `defaultPosition`, `defaultRotation`, `metadata`
- Integrated Convex mutations and queries directly in the wrapper
- Handles initialization, position saving, and state management internally
- Manages saved position loading and fallback to default positions

**Simplified Component Interface**: Object components now focus purely on rendering:
- Removed all database imports and hooks
- Eliminated state management and effect hooks
- Cleaned component props to only pass necessary data to wrapper
- Reduced component size by 50-70% (Plant: 94→35 lines, Couch: 105→45 lines)

### Technical Changes

**Enhanced DraggableObjectWrapper**:
```typescript
interface DraggableObjectProps {
    // Original props
    children: React.ReactNode;
    objectType: 'team-cluster' | 'furniture';
    objectId: string;
    isDragEnabled?: boolean;
    showHoverEffect?: boolean;
    
    // New database-related props
    companyId?: Id<"companies">;
    meshType?: string;
    defaultPosition?: [number, number, number];
    defaultRotation?: [number, number, number];
    metadata?: {
        teamId?: Id<"teams">;
        color?: string;
    };
}
```

**Simplified Component Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before: 94 lines with database logic
export default function Plant({ position, objectId, companyId, isDragEnabled }: PlantProps) {
    // 50+ lines of database logic...
    
    return (
        <DraggableObjectWrapper objectType="furniture" objectId={objectId} onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
            {/* rendering logic */}
        </DraggableObjectWrapper>
    );
}

// After: 35 lines, pure rendering
export default function Plant({ position, objectId, companyId, isDragEnabled }: PlantProps) {
    return (
        <DraggableObjectWrapper
            objectType="furniture"
            objectId={objectId}
            companyId={companyId}
            meshType="plant"
            defaultPosition={position}
            defaultRotation={[0, 0, 0]}
        >
            {/* rendering logic only */}
        </DraggableObjectWrapper>
    );
}
```

### Components Updated
- **Plant**: 94 → 35 lines (-59 lines)
- **Couch**: 105 → 45 lines (-60 lines)  
- **Bookshelf**: 137 → 70 lines (-67 lines)
- **Pantry**: 161 → 70 lines (-91 lines)
- **TeamCluster**: 147 → 70 lines (-77 lines)

**Total Code Reduction**: ~354 lines removed from components, centralized into wrapper

### Benefits

- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated massive code duplication across components
- **Maintainability**: Database logic changes only need to happen in one place
- **Consistency**: All objects now handle database operations identically
- **Debugging**: Centralized logic makes issues easier to track and fix
- **Performance**: More efficient with shared database operations
- **Scalability**: Adding new draggable objects requires minimal boilerplate
- **Type Safety**: Consistent interface for all object database operations

### Database Integration
The wrapper now handles the complete database lifecycle:
1. **Initialization**: Creates office object in database on first mount
2. **Position Loading**: Loads saved position from database or uses default
3. **Drag Persistence**: Saves new positions to database on drag end
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging for all database operations
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Only enables drag when database object is ready

### Future Improvements
- Consider extracting database logic into a custom hook for even cleaner separation
- Add rotation persistence to the centralized system
- Implement bulk position updates for performance optimization
- Add undo/redo functionality at the wrapper level

This refactoring represents a significant architectural improvement that makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend with new draggable objects.

## Previous Progress: Human Collaboration System

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive human collaboration system that allows AI agents to request input, approval, or review from humans during task execution. The system seamlessly integrates with the existing task/todo workflow.

### How It Works

#### 1. Agent Requests Human Input
When an AI agent needs human input, it calls the `humanCollabTool` with:
- **message**: Clear description of what's needed
- **type**: approval, review, question, or permission  
- **context**: Optional additional context

#### 2. System Response
The system:
- Creates a visible request message in the chat with emoji indicators
- Stores the request in the database for tracking
- Blocks the current task with status "blocked"
- Generates a unique `requestRef` for linking responses

#### 3. Human Response
When humans respond, they include the `requestRef` in their message. The system:
- Automatically links the response to the original request
- Marks the human request as "responded" 
- Adds the response as a new todo item
- Unblocks the task and restarts the workflow
- Agent continues with the human's input

### Workflow Integration

**Task Blocking**: Uses the existing `setTaskStatus("blocked")` mechanism
**Automatic Resumption**: When new input arrives for a blocked task, it automatically unblocks via `addTodoToTask`
**Workflow Restart**: Blocked tasks restart with a new workflow when input is received
**Context Preservation**: Full conversation context is maintained across blocking/unblocking

### Examples

```
Agent: "I need approval to delete these 50 files from the old project"
→ Task blocks, user sees: "✋ Human Input Requested (approval)"

User: "Yes, go ahead. Reference: abc-123"  
→ Task unblocks, agent continues with approval

Agent: "Please review this code before I deploy"
→ Task blocks, user sees: "👀 Human Input Requested (review)"

User: "Looks good but change line 15. Reference: def-456"
→ Task unblocks, agent makes changes and continues
```

### Technical Implementation

**Database**: `humanRequests` table tracks all requests and responses
**Workflow**: `chatWorkflow.ts` handles blocking/unblocking logic  
**Chat Integration**: `chat.ts` routes responses and manages task status
**Tool Integration**: Added to `createAdvancedTools` for all employees
**UI Component**: `HumanCollabPreview` provides rich visual feedback in chat

### Benefits

- **Seamless**: No separate approval flows, works within existing chat
- **Trackable**: All requests stored and linked to responses
- **Flexible**: Supports various request types with appropriate UX
- **Efficient**: Only blocks when truly needed, auto-resumes when input arrives
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent requests across different threads

## Current State

The system now features a comprehensive human collaboration system, a modern game-like HUD interface, and a detailed employee profile system. Users can:

### Game Interface

- **Web Search**: Research, browsing capabilities
- **Computer Use**: UI automation, system interaction

**Tools** (individual functions within toolsets):
- `createArtifact`, `updateArtifact` (within Artifact Management)
- `uploadFile`, `searchFiles` (within File Management)
- `createTask`, `addTodo` (within Planning System)

### Toolset Configuration Types

**Built-in Toolsets**:
- Defined in the codebase (`/lib/ai/tools/`)
- No configuration required (unlike individual tools)
- Automatically available with core functionality

**MCP Toolsets**:
- External integrations via Model Context Protocol
- Support for SSE (Server-Sent Events) and stdio connections
- Single configuration per logical grouping of functions
- Enable integration with external APIs and services

### Company Toolset Config Micro App

**Purpose**: IT manager interface for managing company-wide toolset registry
**Access**: Available to employees with "it" built-in role and CEOs

**Features**:
- **Toolset Directory**: View all registered toolsets with type, category, and status
- **Add Toolset Interface**: Modal forms for configuring new built-in or MCP toolsets
- **Toolset Statistics**: Dashboard showing total toolsets, built-in vs MCP ratios
- **Type-specific Configuration**: Simple forms for built-in (no config) vs MCP (connection details)

**Built-in Toolsets Included**:
- Artifact Management (Content Creation)
- Planning System (Project Management)
- Memory Management (Data Management)
- Human Collaboration (Collaboration)
- Learning System (Learning)
- Office Management (Office Management)
- File Management (Content Management)
- KPI Management (Analytics)

### Toolset Assignment System

**Assignment Management**:
- IT managers assign toolsets (not individual tools) to employees
- Employees get access to all tools within assigned toolsets
- Assignment at the capability level ("File Management access")
- Simplified permission model

**Database Structure**:
- `toolsets` table with simplified configuration (only MCP needs config)
- `tools` table for individual functions within toolsets
- `employeeToToolsets` junction table for assignments
- Type-safe schema with proper separation of concerns

**API Functions**:
- `assignToolsetToEmployee`: Assign toolset capabilities to employees
- `removeToolsetFromEmployee`: Remove toolset access
- `getToolsetsForEmployee`: Get all toolsets assigned to an employee
- `getEmployeesWithToolset`: Get all employees with specific toolset access
- `getToolsInToolset`: Get individual tools within a toolset

### Migration System

**Migration Functions**:
- `migrateToolsToToolsets`: Converts old tool structure to toolsets
- `cleanupOldToolsData`: Removes old data after successful migration
- Intelligent mapping of old tools to appropriate toolsets
- Preserves all existing assignments and configurations

### Benefits

- **Intuitive Model**: Matches how tools are actually deployed (MCP servers, modules)
- **Simplified Assignment**: "Give Sarah file management" vs 12 individual functions
- **Better Organization**: Related functionality grouped logically
- **Easier Configuration**: One config per logical capability
- **Reduced Complexity**: Less granular permission management
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new toolsets and MCP integrations
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
- **Migration Support**: Smooth transition from old structure

## Next Steps
