## Previous Progress: Human Collaboration System

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive human collaboration system that allows AI agents to request input, approval, or review from humans during task execution. The system seamlessly integrates with the existing task/todo workflow.

### How It Works

#### 1. Agent Requests Human Input
When an AI agent needs human input, it calls the `humanCollabTool` with:
- **message**: Clear description of what's needed
- **type**: approval, review, question, or permission  
- **context**: Optional additional context

#### 2. System Response
The system:
- Creates a visible request message in the chat with emoji indicators
- Stores the request in the database for tracking
- Blocks the current task with status "blocked"
- Generates a unique `requestRef` for linking responses

#### 3. Human Response
When humans respond, they include the `requestRef` in their message. The system:
- Automatically links the response to the original request
- Marks the human request as "responded" 
- Adds the response as a new todo item
- Unblocks the task and restarts the workflow
- Agent continues with the human's input

### Workflow Integration

**Task Blocking**: Uses the existing `setTaskStatus("blocked")` mechanism
**Automatic Resumption**: When new input arrives for a blocked task, it automatically unblocks via `addTodoToTask`
**Workflow Restart**: Blocked tasks restart with a new workflow when input is received
**Context Preservation**: Full conversation context is maintained across blocking/unblocking

### Examples

```
Agent: "I need approval to delete these 50 files from the old project"
‚Üí Task blocks, user sees: "‚úã Human Input Requested (approval)"

User: "Yes, go ahead. Reference: abc-123"  
‚Üí Task unblocks, agent continues with approval

Agent: "Please review this code before I deploy"
‚Üí Task blocks, user sees: "üëÄ Human Input Requested (review)"

User: "Looks good but change line 15. Reference: def-456"
‚Üí Task unblocks, agent makes changes and continues
```

### Technical Implementation

**Database**: `humanRequests` table tracks all requests and responses
**Workflow**: `chatWorkflow.ts` handles blocking/unblocking logic  
**Chat Integration**: `chat.ts` routes responses and manages task status
**Tool Integration**: Added to `createAdvancedTools` for all employees
**UI Component**: `HumanCollabPreview` provides rich visual feedback in chat

### Benefits

- **Seamless**: No separate approval flows, works within existing chat
- **Trackable**: All requests stored and linked to responses
- **Flexible**: Supports various request types with appropriate UX
- **Efficient**: Only blocks when truly needed, auto-resumes when input arrives
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent requests across different threads

## Current State

The system now features both a comprehensive human collaboration system and a modern game-like HUD interface. Users can:

### Game Interface
- Use the speed dial for quick access to tasks, settings, and future features
- Monitor real-time performance through the stats HUD
- Manage pending human collaboration requests through an intuitive task interface
- Experience a gaming-style interface that makes work management engaging

### AI Collaboration
- Request approvals for sensitive operations
- Get human review on work before proceeding  
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Request permissions for actions requiring authorization

### Human Collaboration Tool Preview

Created a visual tool preview component (`HumanCollabPreview`) that provides rich feedback for human collaboration requests in the chat interface:

**Visual Design**:
- Beige/amber color scheme (human skin tone theme) to distinguish from other tools
- Full dark mode support with appropriate color variants
- UserIcon and MessageIcon for clear visual identity  
- Animated pulse effects while waiting for response
- Type-specific colors: orange for approval, yellow for review, red for permission

**Features**:
- Shows request type with appropriate emoji (‚úã approval, üëÄ review, ‚ùì question, üîê permission)
- Displays main message with MessageIcon
- Optional context section with lightbulb icon
- Status badges (APPROVAL NEEDED, REVIEW REQUESTED, etc.)
- Waiting indicator with animated pulse
- Clean "request sent" state with MessageIcon when completed

**Integration**:
- Added to `components/chat/messages/tool-previews/`
- Exported from tool-previews index
- Integrated into message.tsx switch statements for both 'call' and 'result' states
- Handles `requestHumanInput` tool calls

The component follows the existing hacker/gamer aesthetic while using warm beige tones to clearly indicate human involvement in the workflow. Includes full dark mode support with appropriate color adjustments for both light and dark themes.
