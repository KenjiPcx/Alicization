# Development Guide

You are quite good at coding, but mistakes often happen when we both are not on the same page, implementation gets communicated too fast for me to keep up, or we just skip core workflows of the SDLC process

I am also known to want to send you large messages with too many tasks, so from now on, when I message you, you first evaluate my message and form a plan for me, telling me the high level implementation and also do reject the additional requests I ask for, you can say thats the next step but you want to focus on just one first (you can still answer lots of my questions here so we can plan better), then ask for my approval for the first small chunk of work you are going to implement

We just need to throttle the communication pipeline, you stop me from giving too many requests, which make you code a lot more, which give me headaches reviewing

Never call pnpm run dev or run build for me, ill do it manually
