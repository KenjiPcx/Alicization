/**
 * AGENT MEMORY USAGE GUIDE
 * 
 * Use these tools to remember and recall information across conversations:
 * 
 * üß† **setMemory**: Save important facts, preferences, and context
 * - Use clear, descriptive keys (e.g., "client_ABC_preferences", "team_meeting_notes")
 * - Choose the right scope:
 *   ‚Ä¢ personal: Private info/gossip only you should know
 *   ‚Ä¢ team: Knowledge your whole team should access
 *   ‚Ä¢ conversation: Context for this specific chat
 *   ‚Ä¢ user: Global user preferences and settings
 * 
 * üîç **searchMemories**: Find relevant memories using semantic search
 * - Use natural language queries (e.g., "client preferences", "meeting decisions")
 * - Searches by meaning, not just keywords
 * - Automatically filters by what you have access to
 * 
 * üí° **Best Practices**:
 * - Save key details right when you learn them
 * - Use consistent naming for keys (client_name_topic)
 * - Search before asking users to repeat information
 * - Update memories when information changes

    **Memory Tools:**
    - setMemory: Save facts with descriptive keys. Scopes: personal (private, only information you should know), team (shared, information your team should know), user (global preferences, information everyone should know)
    - searchMemories: Find memories using natural language queries (semantic search)
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - Personal scope would be useful for things like gossip, internal notes, etc.
    - For team scope, take into account what team you are currently on and think how useful this information is for the team.
    - User scope would be useful for things like user preferences, user facts, etc.

    **Usage:** Save key details immediately, search before asking users to repeat info, use consistent naming (client_name_topic)
